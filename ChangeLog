	* For each event, keep the previous event state, too.

	* Event update time reduced to every 60 seconds.  This is both a
	  blessing and a curse, as the poor ruby threading results in the
	  GUI locking up for several seconds when an update occurs.  Also,
	  because the scroll window is not saved/restored when updates
	  occur, you can easily lose your viewing position.

	* A list of events and their IDs can be found in "event_list.csv".
	  Note that this list may not be complete, and that, yes, anet
	  really does have an empty/blank name associated with an event
	  ID.

	* Added support for marking of "group events".  A group event has
	  a "(G)" prepended to its event name/description.  Group events
	  are stored/listed by evend id in a simple .csv file named,
	  "group_events.csv", for easy editing.
